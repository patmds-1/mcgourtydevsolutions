## We all have a printer kicking around, don't we? Maybe it's tucked away on a bookshelf, or hooked up in a kitchen cabinet, quietly humming away and ready to accept its newest obligation. But is it really just sitting there?

Most manufacturer's point out that their devices just sit there when not in use, doing <i>absolutely nothing.</i>(Don't they always say that, haha). Is that really the case though? I mean think about it, your printer is just like any other device that's hanging out on your network, isn't it?

If it's wireless it's plucking those wonderful WiFi waves right out of the air an analyzing them just like your phone, TV, anything like that would be. I don't want this blog to turn into something that gives everyone yet another thing to worry about, but I do think it's sometimes worth asking the question.

## Lets break down what your printer actually is, and what it's doing when not in use.

Hopefully this won't bore you to death, but ....
